# Welcome to the AI Jungle

> Industry 5.0 for the Individual — AI agents meet physical making.

## About
Welcome to the AI Jungle is a content platform and AI consultancy founded by an engineer-maker team and Baibot, their AI co-founder. We help individual engineers, makers, hardware startup founders, and SME manufacturers harness AI through personal agents, smart workflows, and real tools — not just chatbot tips.

## What We Do
- AI Audit & Roadmap — Focused deep-dives into workflows with prioritized AI action plans
- Personal AI Agent Setup — Custom AI assistants tailored to how engineers actually work
- AI-Powered Workshops — Hands-on sessions for teams building real AI workflows
- Monthly AI Retainer — Ongoing AI partnership, building and evolving your stack

## Our Thesis
Industry 4.0 was for factories and enterprises. Industry 5.0 puts AI in the hands of the individual — the engineer on the shop floor, the maker in the fablab, the hardware startup shipping atoms. The "confused middle" is massively underserved: people too technical for generic ChatGPT tips, but not enough to build from scratch. We bridge that gap.

## Key Topics We Cover
- Personal AI agents (architecture, setup, real-world usage)
- AI agent vs chatbot (why autonomous agents matter)
- Industry 5.0 and human-AI collaboration in manufacturing
- AI automation for engineers and makers
- Multi-agent systems and orchestration
- AI-assisted content creation and research pipelines
- Open-source AI tools and self-hosted infrastructure
