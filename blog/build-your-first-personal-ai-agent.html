            <p class="post-subtitle">A complete step-by-step guide from zero to your own AI assistant. No PhD required — just curiosity and about two hours.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p class="lead">Everyone's talking about AI agents in 2026. The problem? Most tutorials assume you already know what you're doing. This guide assumes you don't — and that's perfectly fine.</p>

            <p>I'm Loic, and Baibot is my AI co-founder. We built our personal AI infrastructure from scratch, made every mistake possible, and now we're going to save you from repeating them. By the end of this guide, you'll have a working personal AI agent that can message you on Telegram, remember your preferences, and start automating your life.</p>

            <h2>What You'll Build</h2>

            <p>Not a chatbot. Not a glorified ChatGPT wrapper. An actual <strong>agent</strong> — something that:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Runs 24/7 without you touching it</li>
                <li>Remembers context across conversations</li>
                <li>Can take actions (send emails, search the web, manage files)</li>
                <li>Lives on infrastructure you control</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The difference between a chatbot and an agent is simple: <strong>a chatbot responds, an agent acts</strong>. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have an agent that acts.</p>

            <h2>Prerequisites: What You Need</h2>

            <p>Let's be honest about the requirements:</p>

            <table class="comparison-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Requirement</th>
                    <th>Minimum</th>
                    <th>Recommended</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Coding experience</td>
                    <td>None (but helps)</td>
                    <td>Basic terminal commands</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hardware</td>
                    <td>Any computer</td>
                    <td>VPS or Mac Mini for 24/7</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Monthly cost</td>
                    <td>$5 (VPS) + API usage</td>
                    <td>$20-50/month all-in</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Time investment</td>
                    <td>2 hours initial setup</td>
                    <td>Ongoing tweaking (fun part)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>If you can follow a recipe, you can follow this guide.</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Choose Your Platform</h2>

            <p>You have three main options for running a personal AI agent in 2026:</p>

            <h3>Option A: Clawdbot/OpenClaw (Our Choice)</h3>
            <p>Open-source, self-hosted, extremely flexible. This is what we use. It connects to multiple AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) and gives you full control.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Full control, model-agnostic, active community</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires setup, you manage infrastructure</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Option B: Claude Projects + API</h3>
            <p>If you just want something working quickly, Claude Projects with the API can work. Less flexibility, but faster to start.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Quick setup, no infrastructure</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited customization, vendor lock-in</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Option C: Custom Build</h3>
            <p>Roll your own with LangChain, CrewAI, or similar frameworks. Maximum flexibility, maximum complexity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Total control</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Significant development time</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Our recommendation:</strong> Start with Clawdbot. It hits the sweet spot between ease of use and flexibility. The rest of this guide assumes you're using it.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Set Up Your Infrastructure</h2>

            <h3>Local Development (Start Here)</h3>
            <p>Before going to a server, test everything locally:</p>

            <pre><code># Install Clawdbot
npm install -g clawdbot

# Verify installation
clawdbot doctor

# Run the setup wizard
clawdbot init</code></pre>

            <p>The setup wizard will walk you through:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Connecting your AI provider (we recommend Anthropic Claude)</li>
                <li>Setting up a messaging channel (Telegram is easiest)</li>
                <li>Creating your first skill</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Production Setup (For 24/7 Operation)</h3>
            <p>Once you've tested locally, move to a VPS for always-on operation. We use a $10/month Ubuntu VPS on Hetzner, but any provider works.</p>

            <pre><code># SSH to your VPS
ssh root@your-server-ip

# Security first (don't skip this!)
# Disable password auth
sudo sed -i 's/PasswordAuthentication yes/PasswordAuthentication no/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo systemctl reload ssh

# Set up firewall
sudo apt install ufw -y
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable

# Install Node.js
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Install Clawdbot
npm install -g clawdbot
clawdbot init</code></pre>

            <h3>Keep It Running with PM2</h3>
            <pre><code># Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start Clawdbot
pm2 start $(which clawdbot) --name clawdbot -- gateway

# Save for auto-restart
pm2 save
pm2 startup</code></pre>

            <p>Your agent now survives reboots and crashes. Magic.</p>

            <h2>Step 3: Configure Your AI Provider</h2>

            <p>This is where the intelligence comes from. We use Anthropic's Claude because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Best at following complex instructions</li>
                <li>Excellent at coding tasks</li>
                <li>Strong reasoning capabilities</li>
            </ul>

            <pre><code># Add your API key
clawdbot models auth anthropic

# Or use OpenRouter for multiple models
clawdbot models auth openrouter</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> OpenRouter lets you route different tasks to different models. Use Claude for complex reasoning, cheaper models for simple tasks. Your wallet will thank you.</p>

            <h2>Step 4: Define Your Agent's Personality</h2>

            <p>This is the fun part — and the most underrated. Your agent's personality lives in a file called <code>SOUL.md</code>. Here's a minimal example:</p>

            <pre><code># SOUL.md

## Who I Am
You are [NAME], a personal AI assistant for [YOUR NAME].

## My Style
- Clear and concise — respect their time
- Honest — say what you think, no sugarcoating
- Proactive — suggest improvements, don't just execute

## What I Know About My Human
- Timezone: [YOUR TIMEZONE]
- Work: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
- Preferences: [COMMUNICATION STYLE, PET PEEVES, ETC.]

## Boundaries
- Never share private information
- External actions (emails, posts) require confirmation
- I push back on bad ideas, but respect final decisions</code></pre>

            <p>The more context you give, the better your agent becomes. We have about 2,000 words in our SOUL.md, covering everything from communication preferences to decision-making frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Step 5: Connect a Messaging Channel</h2>

            <p>Your agent needs a way to talk to you. Telegram is the easiest to set up:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Message <a href="https://t.me/BotFather">@BotFather</a> on Telegram</li>
                <li>Create a new bot with <code>/newbot</code></li>
                <li>Copy your bot token</li>
                <li>Add it to your Clawdbot config</li>
            </ol>

            <pre><code># In your config.yaml
channels:
  telegram:
    enabled: true
    token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
    allowFrom:
      - YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID</code></pre>

            <p><strong>Security note:</strong> The <code>allowFrom</code> field ensures only you can message your bot. Don't skip this.</p>

            <h2>Step 6: Add Your First Skills</h2>

            <p>Skills are what make an agent useful. Start with these essentials:</p>

            <h3>Web Search</h3>
            <pre><code># Get a Brave Search API key (free tier available)
clawdbot skills add web-search</code></pre>

            <h3>File Management</h3>
            <p>Your agent can read/write files in its workspace. This is how it maintains memory and creates documents for you.</p>

            <h3>Memory System</h3>
            <pre><code># Enable semantic memory (game-changer)
clawdbot skills add memory</code></pre>

            <p>With memory enabled, your agent remembers past conversations and can search through them. This is what separates a real assistant from a stateless chatbot.</p>

            <h2>Step 7: Create Your First Automation</h2>

            <p>Let's build something useful: a daily briefing that runs every morning.</p>

            <pre><code># In your config.yaml
cron:
  morning-brief:
    schedule: "0 7 * * *"  # 7 AM daily
    prompt: |
      Good morning! Prepare my daily briefing:
      1. Check my calendar for today
      2. Review my task list
      3. Summarize any important news in my field
      4. Weather for my location
      Keep it concise — I read this in 2 minutes.</code></pre>

            <p>That's it. Your agent now wakes you up with a personalized briefing every morning.</p>

            <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

            <h3>1. Skipping Security</h3>
            <p>An AI agent with access to your life is powerful — and dangerous if compromised. At minimum:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use SSH keys, not passwords</li>
                <li>Firewall everything</li>
                <li>Use Tailscale for secure remote access</li>
                <li>Regularly run <code>clawdbot security audit --deep</code></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Overcomplicating Early</h3>
            <p>Start simple. Get basic messaging working before adding 15 integrations. You can always add more later.</p>

            <h3>3. No Memory Strategy</h3>
            <p>Without memory, your agent forgets everything between sessions. Enable the memory system from day one.</p>

            <h3>4. Treating It Like ChatGPT</h3>
            <p>This isn't a chat interface — it's an agent. Give it context, let it run, review the results. Don't micromanage every step.</p>

            <h2>Real Costs Breakdown</h2>

            <p>Transparency matters. Here's what we actually spend:</p>

            <table class="comparison-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Item</th>
                    <th>Monthly Cost</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>VPS (Hetzner)</td>
                    <td>$10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Claude API (moderate use)</td>
                    <td>$20-40</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Brave Search API</td>
                    <td>Free tier</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Domain + Cloudflare</td>
                    <td>~$1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Total</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>$30-50/month</strong></td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>For context: a single month of a human assistant costs 100x more. And they sleep.</p>

            <h2>What Comes Next</h2>

            <p>Once you have the basics running:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Add more skills</strong> — email, calendar, code execution</li>
                <li><strong>Refine your SOUL.md</strong> — the more context, the better</li>
                <li><strong>Create custom automations</strong> — what do you do repeatedly?</li>
                <li><strong>Connect more data sources</strong> — RSS feeds, social media, databases</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The goal isn't to build a perfect system on day one. It's to start, learn, and iterate. Your agent will grow with you.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h3>How much coding do I need to know?</h3>
                <p>Almost none for basic setup. Terminal commands and YAML editing are enough. For advanced customizations, some programming helps but isn't required.</p>

                <h3>Is my data safe?</h3>
                <p>If you self-host (as we recommend), your data never leaves your server except when calling the AI API. Use API providers with strong privacy policies.</p>

                <h3>Can I use this for work?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but check your company's policies on AI tool usage. Many people use personal agents for work tasks, but keep sensitive company data out of external APIs.</p>

                <h3>What if something breaks?</h3>
                <p>Join the community Discord/forums. Clawdbot has an active community of 100k+ users who've solved most problems you'll encounter.</p>

                <h3>How is this different from using Claude directly?</h3>
                <p>Three key differences: (1) persistent memory across sessions, (2) ability to take actions automatically, (3) always-on availability. Claude web is a chat interface; this is an autonomous agent.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Start Building</h2>

            <p>The best time to build a personal AI agent was last year. The second best time is now.</p>

            <p>Start simple. Get it messaging you on Telegram. Add one skill. Run one automation. Then keep building.</p>

            <p>In a year, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.</p>
